# Milestone 7Ô∏è‚É£ Project Documentation (Demo and Report)

## üéØ Objective:
Deliver a comprehensive final presentation of your project, showcasing its features, functionality, and technical implementation. This milestone combines a demo video and a final report to evaluate the project's outcomes, the development process, and team contributions.

## ü•ã Instructions:

### 1. Demo Video:
- Plan Your Demo:
  - Treat the demo as a professional presentation (e.g., a pitch in a conference).
  - Highlight the core value of your system and its technical features.
  - Use a structured narrative to guide viewers through the project.

- Recording Guidelines:
  - Duration: 5 to 7 minutes.
  - Clearly demonstrate:
    - Core Features: How your system solves the identified problem.
    - User Experience: Navigate through all main features, showing how a typical user would interact with the system.
    - Technical Insights: Briefly explain how major functionalities are implemented.
  - Use screen recording tools (e.g., OBS, Camtasia, or built-in OS recorders).
  - Ensure good audio and video quality.

- Submission:
  - Upload the video to YouTube (set visibility to "Unlisted" or "Public").
  - Submit the YouTube link via Blackboard.

### 2. Final Report:
Prepare a professional PDF report (use consistent formatting and structure) covering the following sections:

#### a. Project Overview:
- Title: Final title of your project.
- Executive Summary: Briefly describe the purpose and outcome of the project.

#### b. Technologies and Tools:
- List all technologies, libraries, frameworks, and tools used in the project (e.g., HTML, CSS, React, Node.js, MongoDB, etc.).
- For each item, provide a short description of its purpose in the project.

#### c. GUI Screenshots:
- Include clear screenshots of the main application screens.
- Annotate screenshots to explain key features and design choices.

#### d. Source Code Highlights:
- Include key snippets of your source code that demonstrate:
  - Implementation of core functionalities.
  - Use of algorithms, API integrations, or database queries.
- Provide concise explanations for the included code snippets.
- No need to include all the code files, just core functionalities/features. 

#### e. Open Source Code Reusability:
- Mention any reused or adapted open-source code, libraries, or frameworks.
- Provide proper acknowledgments and licensing information (like Creative Common, MIT, GNU Public licence, etc.).

#### f. Learnings and Reflections:
- Key Learnings: What you and your team learned through this project.
- Limitations: Identify and explain the project's current limitations.
- Future Improvements: What you would do differently if you had more time or resources.

#### g. Team Contributions (Time-sheet):
- Create a timeline worksheet that details:
  - Tasks completed during the project lifecycle.
  - Contributions made by each team member.
  - Hours spent on each task.

### 3. Submission Guidelines:
- Upload the following to Blackboard:
  1. YouTube Link: Submit the URL of your demo video.
  2. PDF Report: Upload the final report in PDF format.
