## GitHub Classroom Instructions

### What is GitHub Classroom?
GitHub Classroom is a tool that automatically creates individual repositories for each student when they accept an assignment. This eliminates the need for manual forking and simplifies the submission process.

### Initial Setup (One-time)
1. **Accept the assignment** by clicking the GitHub Classroom link provided by your instructor
2. **Authorize GitHub Classroom** to access your GitHub account
3. **Your individual repository** will be automatically created and ready for use

### Before Each Lab Session
1. **Clone your assignment repository** (if not already done):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Web-Engineering-KFUPM/[ASSIGNMENT-NAME]-[YOUR-USERNAME].git
   cd [ASSIGNMENT-NAME]-[YOUR-USERNAME]
   ```
2. **Pull any updates** from the remote repository:
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```

## How to Submit Your Work

### During Lab Sessions
1. **Complete the assigned tasks** in your local repository
2. **Add and commit your changes** with descriptive messages:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Complete lab exercise: [brief description]"
   ```
3. **Push your changes** to your assignment repository:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

### Submission Requirements
- **Timing**: Must be pushed during class time
- **Content**: Include all required files and changes
- **Quality**: Code should be functional and well-formatted
- **Documentation**: Add comments where appropriate
- **Commit Messages**: Use descriptive, professional language

### Optional: GitHub Setup Assignment
Students who are new to Git and GitHub can complete an optional setup assignment to familiarize themselves with:
- Basic Git commands (add, commit, push, pull)
- GitHub repository navigation
- Creating and managing branches
- Resolving merge conflicts

This assignment is **not graded** but highly recommended for students with limited Git experience.
