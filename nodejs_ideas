# NodeJS Ideas

## Command-Line To-Do List

Develop a simple command-line application that allows users to add, view, and delete tasks from a to-do list. Utilize Node.js's fs module to read and write tasks to a JSON file, and the readline module to handle user input. This project introduces students to file operations and basic user interaction in Node.js.

## Random Joke Generator

Create a script that fetches a random joke from an external API and displays it in the console. Use Node.js's https module to make GET requests to a joke API, and handle the response to extract and print the joke. This project helps students practice making HTTP requests and processing JSON data.

## File Content Searcher

Build a tool that searches for a specific keyword within a text file and displays the lines where the keyword appears. Employ Node.js's fs module to read the file and process its content line by line. This project enhances understanding of file reading and string manipulation in Node.js.

## Currency Converter CLI

Develop a command-line tool that converts an amount from one currency to another using real-time exchange rates. Utilize Node.js's https module to fetch exchange rates from a public API, and process user input to perform the conversion. This project combines API interaction with command-line input handling.

## Command-Line Tic-Tac-Toe

Develop a two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game that runs in the terminal. Utilize Node.js's readline module to handle player inputs and display the game board after each move. Implement game logic to check for win conditions and handle invalid moves. This project introduces students to synchronous input handling and basic game logic implementation.

## Number Guessing Game

Create a command-line game where the computer randomly selects a number within a specified range, and the player attempts to guess it. After each guess, provide feedback indicating whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct. Use the readline module for input and output operations. This project helps students practice random number generation and conditional logic.

## Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

Implement a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game that allows a player to compete against the computer. The player inputs their choice, and the computer randomly selects its move. Determine the winner based on the standard rules and display the result. This project involves handling user input, generating random choices, and applying game rules to decide the outcome.
